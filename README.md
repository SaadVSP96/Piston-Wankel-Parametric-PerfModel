# Piston-Wankel-Parametric-PerfModel
Piston and Wankel parametric engine performance modeling via empirical and analytical modeling in matlab

This project develops a parametric engine performance model that extrapolates thrust, fuel consumption, and power output across varying altitudes, Mach numbers, and throttle settings. It integrates empirical data with physics-based corrections to generate engine decks for performance analysis and optimization.
